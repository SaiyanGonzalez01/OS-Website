		<center><p>Hi! Im Saiyan! I'm an Eaglercraft/Minecraft Content Creator that likes creating games in HTML, Javascript
		and more!</p></center>

		<center><p>Minecraft Old-School is a hobbie I started when I started to learn html. At first I knew nothing. I only knew how to
		change the title, icon, and some text that was there. I wanted to change how the game worked too. But then
		noticed that I was using the compiled version. I couldn't change a thing because of it being compiled. Fast forward by the end of 2023, I joined Github and forked the Eaglercraft Beta 1.3 repo.
		Then I was able to change everything. And now, I learned to (kinda) code in Java because of it! I wouldn't be able to make this website without my Minecraft Old-School repo.
		I'm glad to be part of Github, and i'm not going anywhere yet!</p></center>
